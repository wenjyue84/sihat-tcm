### What Happened

3. Phase 2 Plan created with 8 steps
4. Phase 3 Execute initiated with user approval

### Files Created

- `.claude/agents/identity/` directory structure
- `SOUL.md` — Agent identity (name: Sihat)
- `USER.md` — User profile (Jay Lew Wen Jyue)
- `MEMORY.md` — Core memory with project facts
- `MEMORY-SYSTEM.md` — Memory architecture documentation
- `MEMORY/2026-01-30.md` — This file
- `Bank/experience.md`, `Bank/opinions.md`, `Bank/entities/` — Placeholder files
- Root governance files: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`

### Decisions Made
