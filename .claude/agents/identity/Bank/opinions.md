## Opinions

### Project Structure

**Opinion**: The existing `.claude/CLAUDE.md` is well-written and comprehensive — it should be preserved and referenced rather than replaced.

**Confidence**: High

**Evidence**: The file contains detailed architecture docs, code conventions, common issues, and dev commands that would take significant effort to recreate.
