*What I (Sihat) have done and learned. First-person perspective.*

### Governance Setup

I was initialized today as part of the meta-skill Phase 3 execution. The project already had a solid `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with detailed architecture documentation, but was missing the identity and memory structure.

I learned that:
- This is a TCM diagnostic platform with both web and mobile apps
- The codebase uses TypeScript strict mode on web, JavaScript on mobile
- DiagnosisWizard requires default import (not named) — this is a common gotcha
