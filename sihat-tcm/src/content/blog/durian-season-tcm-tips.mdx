## The Love-Hate Relationship with Durian

In Malaysia, Durian season is a festival. Whether you are driving by a roadside stall in Raub or feasting on Musang King in SS2, the aroma is unmistakable.

But we all know the aftermath: sore throat, mouth ulcers, pimples, and feeling feverish. In local slang, we call this being **"Heaty"**.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this is exactly right. Durian is considered extremely **Yang** (Hot). It is warming, nourishing, and invigorating—which is great if you have a "Cold" constitution, but for most people in our tropical weather, it's too much fire!

## TCM Tips to "Cool Down" After Durian

### 1. The "Mangosteen" Pairing
Nature is clever. Durian season always coincides with Mangosteen season.
*   **TCM Fact**: Mangosteen is the "Queen of Fruits" and is extremely **Cooling (Yin)**.
*   **Tip**: For every few seeds of durian, eat two mangosteens to neutralize the fire.

### 2. Drink "Salt Water" from the Shell
You might have seen uncles doing this at the stall. It's not a myth!
*   **Why**: Salt has a "descending" energy in TCM and helps clear heat/toxins. Drinking water from the husk (which has cooling properties itself) enhances this effect.

### 3. Herbal Tea (Liang Teh)
If you went overboard (we've all been there), brew some **Chrysanthemum** or **Monk Fruit (Luo Han Guo)** tea.
*   **Avoid**: Ginger tea or Teh Tarik, as these will add more heat to the fire.

## Is Durian Bad for Everyone?
No! If you have **Yang Deficiency** (always cold, pale face, weak knees), durian is actually a powerful tonic. It warms the stomach and kidneys.

**Not sure if you are "Heaty" or "Cold"?**
Don't guess with your health.
