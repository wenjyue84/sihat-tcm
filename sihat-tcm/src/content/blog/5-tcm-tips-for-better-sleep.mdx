## Why Can't I Sleep? The TCM View

In Western medicine, insomnia is often treated with sedatives. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), sleep problems are usually linked to the **Heart** and **Liver**.

The Heart houses the **Shen** (Spirit/Mind). When the Heart is calm, the Shen rests, and you sleep. When the Heart is agitated (by heat, stress, or deficiency), the Shen floats, and you toss and turn.

Here are 5 TCM-approved ways to ground your Shen and get better sleep.

### 1. Soak Your Feet Before Bed
It sounds simple, but a hot foot bath draws energy from your head down to your feet (Kidney channel), calming the mind.
*   **Tip**: Add mugwort or lavender essential oil. Soak for 15-20 minutes.

### 2. The "3-2-1" Dinner Rule
Digestion takes a lot of Qi. If you eat late, your "Stomach Qi" will be busy working, disturbing your Heart.
*   **Rule**: Stop eating 3 hours before bed.

### 3. Acupressure Point: Anmian (Peaceful Sleep)
There is a specific point behind your ear called "Anmian".
*   **Location**: behind the ear, between the mastoid process (bony bump) and the base of the skull.
*   **Action**: Massage gently in circles for 1 minute before lying down.

### 4. Cooling Foods for "Heart Fire"
If you feel restless, hot, and have vivid dreams, you might have "Heart Fire".
*   **Eat**: Lotus seeds (Lian Zi), Lily bulb (Bai He), and Wheat tea.
*   **Avoid**: Spicy food, coffee, and alcohol.

### 5. Check Your Pattern with AI
Insomnia has many causes. Is it Liver Stagnation (stress)? Heart Blood Deficiency (anxiety)? Kidney Yin Deficiency (night sweats)?

Taking a holistic scan can pinpoint the root cause.
