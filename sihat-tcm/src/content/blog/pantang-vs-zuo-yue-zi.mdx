## A Mother's Healing Journey

In Malaysia, seeing a new mother wrapped in layers of clothing, wearing socks, and avoiding air-conditioning is a common sight—whether she is Malay, Chinese, or Indian.

While the recipes differ, the core philosophy of **"Pantang"** (Malay confinement) and **"Zuo Yue Zi"** (Chinese confinement) is remarkably similar. Both systems recognize that childbirth drains the mother's **Qi** and **Blood**, leaving her vulnerable to **Wind (Angin/Feng)** and **Cold**.

## The Shared "Rules" of Recovery

### 1. Removing "Wind" (Buang Angin vs. Qu Feng)
*   **Malay Tradition**: Uses *jamu*, *urut* (massage), and burning stones (*bertungku*) to expel trapped wind.
*   **TCM Tradition**: Uses copious amounts of **Old Ginger**, sesame oil, and rice wine to warm the body and drive out wind-cold.
*   **The Science**: Keeping the body warm improves circulation and helps the uterus contract back to size.

### 2. "Heating" Foods
Both cultures strictly ban "cooling" foods like cucumber, watermelon, or iced drinks.
*   **Potent Ingredients**:
    *   **Malay**: Turmeric (*Kunyit*), Lemongrass (*Serai*), Black Pepper.
    *   **Chinese**: Red Dates, Goji Berries, Dang Gui (Angelica Root).

### 3. Rest is Sacred
Modern culture pushes "bounce back" culture, but traditional wisdom enforces 30-44 days of rest.
In TCM, reading too much or crying during confinement is said to damage the Liver blood, which connects to the eyes.
