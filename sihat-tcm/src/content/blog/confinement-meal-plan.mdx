## Why Diet Matters

Postpartum is a period of "Blood deficiency" and "Qi exhaustion." The right foods restore the uterus and boost energy.

## Key Ingredients

- **Old Ginger**: Expels wind.
- **Sesame Oil**: Lubricates the intestines and boosts immunity.
- **Red Dates & Longan**: Nourish the blood.

## Sample Day 1 Menu

- **Breakfast**: Red Date Porridge.
- **Lunch**: Sesame Oil Chicken.
- **Dinner**: Papaya Fish Soup (boosts lactation).
