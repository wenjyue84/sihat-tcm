## The Liver Connection
In TCM, the Liver is responsible for the smooth flow of Qi. Stress causes "Liver Qi Stagnation," leading to irritability, sighing, and digestive issues.

## Techniques to move Qi

1.  **Exercise**: Cardio moves blood and Qi.
2.  **Sour Foods**: A little vinegar or lemon can help soothe the Liver.
3.  **Deep Breathing**: Regulates the Qi flow.
