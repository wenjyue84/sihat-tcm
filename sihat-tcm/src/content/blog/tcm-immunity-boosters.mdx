## What is Wei Qi?
Wei Qi is your body's shield against external pathogens (wind, cold, damp).

## How to Strengthen It

### 1. Sleep Before 11 PM
This allows your organs to repair and regenerate.

### 2. Avoid Cold Drinks
Cold damages the Spleen, which is the source of Qi production.

### 3. Astralagus Root (Huang Qi)
A classic herb for boosting defensive energy. Consult a practitioner before use.
