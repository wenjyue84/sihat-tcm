## The "Mamak" Dilemma

We Malaysians love to ask: _"Is this food heaty or cooling?"_
But often, we just guess. Let's look at our favorite hawker stall foods through the lens of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

### 1. Nasi Lemak

**Verdict: Heaty & Damp**

- **Why**: The sambal (chili) provides extreme Heat. The coconut milk (santan) is rich and creates "Dampness" (sluggish digestion).
- **Balance It**: Drink warm barley water or herbal tea. Don't pair it with Teh Tarik if you already feel bloated.

### 2. Teh Tarik

**Verdict: Warm & Damp**

- **Why**: Black tea is warming. Condensed milk is very sweet and cloying, leading to Phlegm/Dampness.
- **TCM Tip**: If you have a "wet" cough or lots of phlegm, avoid Teh Tarik. Go for **Teh O Limau (Hot)** to cut through the grease.

### 3. Cendol / ABC

**Verdict: Extremely Cooling (Too Cold!)**

- **Why**: Shaved ice shocks the Spleen/Stomach Qi. While cooling on a hot day, too much ice weakens your digestion over time.
- **Balance It**: Eat it slowly and maybe don't drink the melted ice water at the end.

### 4. Bak Kut Teh

**Verdict: Warming Tonic**

- **Why**: Packed with herbs like Dang Gui, Star Anise, and Cinnamon. It builds Qi and Blood.
- **Caution**: If you have a sore throat or fever, skip this! It's too warming and will make the infection worse.

## Listen to Your Body

There is no "bad" food in TCM, only the wrong food for _your_ body type at that moment.

- **Feeling cold/weak?** Have Nasi Lemak or Bak Kut Teh.
- **Feeling irritable/feverish?** Grab a coconut water or Cendol.
