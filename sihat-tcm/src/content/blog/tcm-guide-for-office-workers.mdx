## The "Tech Neck" Epidemic

In our modern world, many of us spend 8+ hours a day glued to screens. From a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) perspective, this stagnation of Qi and blood leads to pain, stiffness, and fatigue.

### 1. Qi Stagnation
Long periods of inactivity cause Qi to flow poorly, leading to mental fog and irritability.

## Simple Solutions

### Acupressure for Eye Strain
Massaging the **Taiyang** points (temples) and **Jingming** (inner corner of eyes) can relieve strain instantly.

### Tea for Energy
Swap your third coffee for **Goji Berry and Chrysanthemum Tea**. It clarifies the vision and nourishes the Liver Yin, which is often depleted by screen time.

## Posture Correction
Remember to engage your core and keep your screen at eye level.
