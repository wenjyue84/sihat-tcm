## What is Qi?
**Qi** (pronounced "chee") is often translated as "vital energy" or "life force". It's the battery power that runs your metabolism, digestion, and immune system.

When you have abundant Qi, you feel energetic, your digestion is smooth, and you rarely get sick. When you are **Qi Deficient**, your battery is flashing red.

## 5 Signs You Are Qi Deficient

1.  **Fatigue that sleep doesn't fix**: You wake up tired even after 8 hours.
2.  **Shortness of Breath**: You feel winded easily, or your voice is soft and low.
3.  **Spontaneous Sweating**: You sweat even when you aren't doing much physical activity (leaking Qi).
4.  **Bloating/Loose Stools**: Your digestive system is too weak to process food efficiently.
5.  **Pale Tongue**: Check your tongue! Is it pale, puffy, or does it have "teeth marks" (scallops) on the edges? That's a classic sign.

## How to Recharge Your Qi

### 1. Stop "Leaking" Energy
Overworking, overthinking, and sleeping late drain Qi faster than you can make it. Prioritize rest.

### 2. Eat "Qi Tonics"
Foods that are sweet (naturally) and warm help build energy.
*   **Superfoods**: Ginseng, Astragalus root (Huang Qi), Jujube dates, Yams, Oats, and Pumpkin.
*   **Avoid**: Raw salads and ice-cold drinks (they demand too much energy to digest).

### 3. Gentle Movement
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) might deplete you further if you are already empty. Try **Qi Gong** or **Tai Chi**—exercises designed specifically to cultivate energy, not spend it.

### Not Sure?
Qi Deficiency is just one of 9 constitutions. You might also be "Damp" or "Yin Deficient".
Knowing your type is the first step to healing.
