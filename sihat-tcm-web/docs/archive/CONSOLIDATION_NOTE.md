# Documentation Consolidation Note

This archive contains the original documentation files that were consolidated into single comprehensive guides.

## Consolidated Files

### Developer Documentation
- **Original Files**: `DEVELOPER_MANUAL.md` + `DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **New Combined File**: `../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- **Reason**: Both files covered similar topics with overlapping content. The combined guide merges practical getting-started information with advanced topics like performance optimization, security, and monitoring.

### User Documentation
- **Original Files**: `USER_MANUAL.md` + `USER_GUIDES.md`
- **New Combined File**: `../USER_GUIDE.md`
