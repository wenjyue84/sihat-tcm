### 10.2 About TCM Diagnosis

**Q: What is a "syndrome pattern"?**
A: In TCM, a syndrome pattern describes the state of imbalance in your body. It's not a disease name but a description of how your body's systems are functioning.

**Q: Why does the AI ask so many questions?**
A: TCM diagnosis is holistic. The AI needs comprehensive information to identify the root cause, not just treat symptoms.

**Q: Can I have multiple patterns at once?**
A: Yes. TCM recognizes that multiple patterns can coexist. The AI will identify primary and secondary patterns.

A: Use the "Report Q&A" feature to ask questions. You can also consult a TCM practitioner to explain the diagnosis in detail.

A: Herbal formulas should only be taken under the guidance of a licensed TCM practitioner. You can use the One-Click Remedy feature to connect with pharmacy partners who can advise you.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: TCM is about gradual, long-term improvement. Some people notice changes in days, others in weeks. Be patient and consistent.

**Q: Can I combine TCM with Western medicine?**
A: Yes, but inform both your TCM practitioner and Western doctor about all treatments you're receiving to avoid interactions.
