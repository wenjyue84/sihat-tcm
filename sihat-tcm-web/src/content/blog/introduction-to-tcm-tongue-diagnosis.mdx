## What is Tongue Diagnosis?

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the tongue is considered a map of your internal health. It is one of the "Four Pillars of Diagnosis" (Inspection, Listening/Smelling, Inquiry, and Palpation). Unlike a pulse check which gives a momentary reading, the tongue often reflects chronic conditions and the true state of your body's energy (Qi).

## The Key Elements we Look For

When you stick out your tongue for a diagnosis, a practitioner looks at three main things:

1. **Body Color**: Is it pale, red, purple, or pink? This indicates the state of your blood, Qi, and Yin/Yang balance. A **pale** tongue often suggests Qi deficiency or "Cold", while a **red** tongue suggests "Heat".

2. **Coat (Moss)**: The thin layer on top of your tongue. A healthy tongue has a thin, white coat. A **thick, greasy yellow coat** might indicate "Damp-Heat" (often associated with digestion issues or inflammation).

3. **Shape**: Is it swollen/puffy? Does it have teeth marks (scallops) on the sides? A **swollen tongue with teeth marks** is a classic sign of Spleen Qi Deficiency—meaning your digestive system is tired.
